# Search & Recommendation System

Background Intro:

For my internship, I was assigned to work on a personalized item search and recommendation project. It was an interactive web page for users to search mechanical equipment and items based on users’ search history. We used HTML/CSS/JavaScript and AJAX for the front-end page design, and we applied RESTful APIs and Java Servlet for the back-end service. I have mainly worked on the recommendation algorithm to make sure users get recommendations that they are interested in so that users could good user experiences. 


Problem:

At the beginning of first, the project was developed to use history-based recommendation algorithm, which means that users are going to receive recommendations based on their past searching history. if you search one item in the past, it will recommend similar items to you in the future. However, for our new users, we don’t have their past searching history, so they will receive random recommendation which they will probably don’t like it. If users did not gain a good user experience of using our product, consequently, we are going to lose our new users.
